# Warsaw Deep Learning Labs Episode #2

Here you will find instructions and relevant information for the event. Don't hesitate to reach out organizers with any kind of questions.

Feel free to jump in on our event [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/warsawdeeplea-lin3168/shared_invite/enQtNzY3NTE5MTU0NjI5LTljMGY4MmIwODNiNDYwZGIzMzAxNDE3YTVjODdmN2U3NTdkMzQwMjYyOWFjODUzMjIyMWNhOGExZDc2ZDc0NzQ) where @Marek & @M are avalible to answer questions and help out with issues.

### Approach
We believe that people learn best by actually getting down and dirty. Today is the second mini hackaton event and the mission is to build the best Cartpole playing Agent using **OpenAI Gym** & **Artificial neural network** 

### Technologies 

1. We use https://colab.research.google.com to write code
2. We use Tensorflow & Keras.io 
3. We use OpenAI Gym library
3. Acceleration with GPU or TPU is available in Colab.


### Instructions

1. Open Notebook for event & **make a copy** of it. _It's possible to work with the same notebook from multiple computers if shared_.  Link to the notebook: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NqWenvzfNr5mcHWKENS8lg8M0ntNujug](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NqWenvzfNr5mcHWKENS8lg8M0ntNujug) 

3. Work as a team, pause for 5 min every 30 min to discuss current status, what is being done and why it matters.
