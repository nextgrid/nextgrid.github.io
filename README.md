# Welcome to Warsaw Deep Learning Labs 

Here you find instructions and relevant information for the event. Don't hesitate to reach out organizers with any kind of questions.

Feel free to jump in on our event [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/warsawdeeplea-lin3168/shared_invite/enQtNzY3NTE5MTU0NjI5LTljMGY4MmIwODNiNDYwZGIzMzAxNDE3YTVjODdmN2U3NTdkMzQwMjYyOWFjODUzMjIyMWNhOGExZDc2ZDc0NzQ) where @Marek & @M is avalible to answer questions and help out with issues.

### Approche 
We belive that people learn best by actually getting down and dirty. Today is the first mini hackaton event and the mission is to build a image classification model using **Artificial neural network** 

### Technologies 

1. We use https://colab.research.google.com to write code
2. We use Tensorflow & Keras 
3. Acceleration with GPU or TPU is avalible in Colab.


### Instructions

1. Decide on Team name and then fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfA8RnoSp6CX1Y3Esev7iOrbFd7cPOpe54nGlElK7331VT5Vg/viewform) to recive the auth key needed to push model to out webbapp.

2. Open Notbook for tonights event & make a copy of it for you team. It's possible to work at same notbook from multiple computers if shared.

3. Work as a team, paus for 5 min every 30 min to discuss current status, what is beeing done and why it matters. 

4. Submit your model no later than 21:10, instructions how to submit can be found in notebook.
