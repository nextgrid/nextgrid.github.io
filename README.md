# Welcome to Warsaw Deep Learning Labs 

Here you find instructions and relevant information for the event. Don't hesitate to reach out organizers with any kind of questions.

Feel free to jump in on our event [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/warsawdeeplea-lin3168/shared_invite/enQtNzY3NTE5MTU0NjI5LTljMGY4MmIwODNiNDYwZGIzMzAxNDE3YTVjODdmN2U3NTdkMzQwMjYyOWFjODUzMjIyMWNhOGExZDc2ZDc0NzQ) where @Marek & @M are avalible to answer questions and help out with issues.

### Aproach
We believe that people learn best by actually getting down and dirty. Today is the first mini hackaton event and the mission is to build an image classification model using **Artificial neural network** 

### Technologies 

1. We use https://colab.research.google.com to write code
2. We use Tensorflow & Keras 
3. Acceleration with GPU or TPU is available in Colab.


### Instructions

1. Decide on a team name and then fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfA8RnoSp6CX1Y3Esev7iOrbFd7cPOpe54nGlElK7331VT5Vg/viewform) to receive the auth key needed to push model out to webbapp.

2. Open Notebook for the tonights event & **make a copy** of it for your team. _It's possible to work with the same notebook from multiple computers if shared_.  Link to the notebook: [https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-bGQenOf0zZMegVdyh5Z8DkeBU_7bos3](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-bGQenOf0zZMegVdyh5Z8DkeBU_7bos3) 

3. Work as a team, pause for 5 min every 30 min to discuss current status, what is being done and why it matters. 

4. Submit your model no later than 21:10. Instructions how to submit can be found in the notebook.
